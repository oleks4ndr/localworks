## Special Instructions for Form 1

**Note**: Before attempting to log-in, please ensure that the api is connected (see the indicator on the landing page).

Since this app requires authentication, there are two account provided below (a customer and tradesperson account). The tradesperson account already has a pre-filled and published Trades Profile which you can edit, unpublish. Otherwise, you can create a new profile and make a new Trades Profile from the Profile tab.

_Customer Profile info_

-   Password: password123

_Tradesperson Profile info_

-   Email: plumbermike@email.com
-   Password: password123

[https://localworks.onrender.com/profile](https://localworks.onrender.com/profile)

## Special Instructions for Form 2

To access the second form, you must first be authenticated (logged in). The second form is quite simple and allows the user to change their display name.

## URL for form 3 (current milestone)

Two forms created for full implementation:

Firstly the [create trades profile form](https://localworks.onrender.com/create-trades-profile)

[https://localworks.onrender.com/create-trades-profile](https://localworks.onrender.com/create-trades-profile)

Secondly, the Send Message form is accessible through the profile card modals on the [dashboard](https://localworks.onrender.com/dashboard). (Click details on a public card and scroll down to "Send Message" button which will reveal a message form).

## Special Instructions for Form 3

To access the third form, the user once again has to be authentication, and has to have the role of a tradesperson. This can either be achieved by creating a new account with the Account Type set to Tradesperson, or if the account was created as a Customer role, there is an option to switch the account role to a tradesperson from the [profile page](https://localworks.onrender.com/profile).

The Create Trades Profile form allows for a tradesperson to fill out information about themselves or their business and make that info public in the shape of a profile card on the dashboard.
